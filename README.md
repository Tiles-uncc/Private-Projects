# My Projects

In this repository, you will find code and assignment details regarding every project that I, Tyler Iles, have worked on. These projects include:

* An AI that uses uninformed and informed search algorithms to solve a randomly generated maze
* A simulation between a client and a server utilizing TCP/IP and UDP protocols
* An AI that uses value iteration to solve an MDP (Markov Decision Process)
* An AI that uses three different kinds of classification models to classify handwritten digits given in the MNIST dataset.
* An AI that utilizes neural networking for regression and classification algorithms
* An AI that uses four linear regression algorithms to predict the house prices of Boston homes.
* A recreation of Pacman
* A platformer game prototype

For a brief description of each of the projects and to guide you, the reader, through the projects, read through the README.

## Maze Search AI

The Python files within [this repository](Maze%20Search%20AI) were what I worked on when I was in my Intro to Artificial Intelligence class. My group and I worked on some of this code together, but the final submission, which is present here, was my individual submission. Our group started working on this project on September 30th, 2021, and I ended up wrapping up the project around October 17th, 2021. A quick note; the Local Search Algorithm was never finished and thus never met assignment expectations, but I chose to share it anyways to demonstrate my fundamental understanding of a local search algorithm, even if the understanding seems rudimentary. For more assignment details, visit the [Maze Search AI](Maze%20Search%20AI) repository and look for the pdf that says "[Searching assignments (2).pdf](Maze%20Search%20AI/Searching%20assignments%20(2).pdf)". The report is also in the repository, though it did not go into as much detail as the teacher wanted.

## TCP/IP and UDP Simulation

The files found [here](Server-Client%20Simulation) were a part of my Intro to Computer Networks class. In this assignment, I was tasked to simulate a client-server socket utilizing TCP and UDP protocols. The four python files were the result. Note that the file name "main.py" is the TCP Server side of the TCP simulation. For more assignment details, see the [README](Server-Client%20Simulation/README.md) in the [Server-Client Simulation](Server-Client%20Simulation) repository. Also, in case it needs to be iterated, the four .py files and screenshots were put in a .zip before submission, although the screenshots will not be found as I decided to not upload them to the GitHub repository.

## Value Iteration AI

The Value Iteration AI was another project I worked on in my Intro to AI class. This was a group submission that was worked on from November 16th, 2021 through December 2nd, 2021. For more details on the assignment, see the [pdf](Value%20Iteration%20AI/Value%20Iteration%20Assignment.pdf) within the [Value Iteration AI](Value%20Iteration%20AI) repository.

## Classification AI

This AI was worked on while I was in my Introduction to Machine Learning class. It was my job to code an AI that uses Classification algorithms to classify handwritten digits given in the MNIST dataset. I worked on the AI from April 4th, 2022 through April 11th, 2022. For more assignment details and grading, see the [Jupyter Notebook](classification/2-classification.ipynb) within the [classification](classification) repository.

## Neural Networks AI

This AI was also worked on while I was in my Introduction to Machine Learning class. It was my job to code an AI that uses Neural Networks to enhance classification and regression algorithms. I worked on the AI from May 2nd, 2022 through May 9th, 2022. For more assignment details and grading, see the [Jupyter Notebook](neural_networks/3-neural-networks.ipynb) within the [neural_networks](neural_networks) repository.

## Regression AI

This AI was also worked on while I was in my Introduction to Machine Learning class. It was my job to code an AI that uses Regression algorithms to predict the housing prices of Boston homes using a related dataset. I worked on the AI from March 7th, 2022 through March 14th, 2022. The [README](regression/README.md) within the [regression](regression) repository describes how to set up a new environment in Anaconda to run the files. For more assignment details and grading, see the [Jupyter Notebook](regression/1-linear-regression.ipynb) within the [regression](regression) repository.

## Pacman
This is a recreating of Pacman coded in Unity with the help of a YouTube tutorial. The link to the tutorial and game are down below.

## Platformer Prototype
This is a 2D platformer game prototype developed in Unity. All assets are mine except for the coins and player model. Link to the game is down below.
